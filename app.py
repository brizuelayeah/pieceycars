IMPORTANT NOTES TO USE PIECEYCARS APP:

    --> Users passwords (username: password):
        - Connor McGregor: connor1
        - Michael OHalloran: michael2
        - Bennet Riordan: bennet3
        - Fintan Lukes: fintan4
        - Conor Murphy: conor5
        - Daniel Steve: daniel6
        - You can register yourself with the username and password you want

    --> Once you are logged in, you MUST log out to access properly 
        the landing page (route: http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

    --> You should execute the "schema.sql" file before running the app

    --> As commented in line 400 of this file, there's a problem when searching for 
        pieces with piece name = "Grilles", because there are more than 1 grilles registered,
        but only one appears. This doesn't happen with other pieces.
    
    --> I don't know how to let a user upload a real image to the system, so in order to simulate it,
        when a user registers a new piece or a car, he's asked just for its "fake" image URL.
    
    --> When searching a piece depending on the user cars (route in line 346), you must select a car for
        which specifications (brand, model...) match an existing piece in the system if you want to see 
        the pieces available for that car. If not, no piece will be showed, because there could be no pieces
        that match that car specifications.
        For example, when logging in with user "Connor McGregor", you can select his Audi A1-A4, because an 
        "AUDI A1-A4" from 2016 is registered in the system.
